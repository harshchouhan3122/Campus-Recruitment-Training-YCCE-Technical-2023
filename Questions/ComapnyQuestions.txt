1. Implement a stack with push(), pop(), peek() and display()


2. Next larger element
Example 1:
Input: 
N = 4, arr[] = [1 3 2 4]
Output:
3 4 4 -1
Explanation:
In the array, the next larger element 
to 1 is 3 , 3 is 4 , 2 is 4 and for 4 ? 
since it doesn't exist, it is -1.


3. Edit Distance
Given two strings s and t. Return the minimum number of operations required to 
convert s to t.
Example 1:
Input: 
s = "ycce", t = "ycsce"
Output: 1
Explanation: One operation is required 
inserting 's' between two 'e's of s.
Example 2:
Input : 
s = "gfg", t = "gfg"
Output: 
0
Explanation: Both strings are same.


4. Stock span problem
Example 1:
Input: 
N = 7, price[] = [100 80 60 70 60 75 85]
Output:
1 1 1 2 1 4 6
Explanation:
Traversing the given input span for 100 will be 1, 
80 is smaller than 100 so the span is 1, 
60 is smaller than 80 so the span is 1, 
70 is greater than 60 so the span is 2,
60 is smaller than 70 so the span is 1,
75 is greater than 60 so the span is 2,
85 is smaller than 75 so the span is 1,
Hence the output will be 1 1 1 2 1 2 1.

					Accenture


1. Write a function to validate if the provided two strings are anagrams or not. If the
two strings are anagrams, then return ‘yes’. Otherwise, return ‘no’.
Input:
Input 1: 1st string
Input 2: 2nd string
Output:
(If they are anagrams, the function will return ‘yes’. Otherwise, it will return ‘no’.)
Example
Input 1: Listen
Input 2: Silent
Output:
Yes
Explanation
Listen and Silent are anagrams (an anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters
of the other word)


2. Execute the given function.
LargeSmallSum(arr)
Input:
Arr: 3 2 1 7 5 4
Output:
8
Explanation
The largest element is 7.
The smallest element at is 1.
The output is 8 (7+1)


3. Solve the following
Productsmallpair(sum,arr)
Example
Input:
Sum: 9
Arr: 5 4 2 3 9 1 7
Output:
2
Explanation
From the array of integers, we have to select the two smallest numbers, i.e 2 and 1. 
Sum
of these two (2 + 1) = 3. This is less than 9 (3 < 9). The product of these two is 2 (2 x 1 =
2) Hence the output is integer 2.
Sample input:
Sum: 4
Arr: 9 8 –7 3 9 3
Sample output:
–21


4. Execute the given function.
def differenceofSum(n.m)
The function takes two integrals m and n as arguments. You are required to obtain the total of 
all integers ranging between 1 to n (both inclusive) which are not divisible by m.
You must also return the distinction between the sum of integers not divisible by m with the 
sum of integers divisible by m.
Example
Input:
m = 6
n = 30
Output:
285
Integers divisible by 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, and 30. Their sum is 90.
Integers that are not divisible by 6 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 
20,
21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29. Their sum is 375.
The difference between them is 285 (375 – 90).


5. You are required to write the code. You can click on compile & run anytime to check the 
compilation/ execution status of the program. The submitted code should be 
logically/syntactically correct and pass all the test cases.
Ques: The program is supposed to calculate the distance between three points.
For
x1 = 1 y1 = 1
x2 = 2 y2 = 4
x3 = 3 y3 = 6
Distance is calculated as : sqrt(x2-x1)2 + (y2-y1)2

2. Mayuri buys “N” no of products from a shop. The shop offers a different percentage of 
discount on each item. She wants to know the item that has the minimum discount offer, so 
that she can avoid buying that and save money.
[Input Format: The first input refers to the no of items; the second input is the item name, price 
and discount percentage separated by comma(,)]
Assume the minimum discount offer is in the form of Integer.
Note: There can be more than one product with a minimum discount.
Sample Input 1:
 4
mobile,10000,20
shoe,5000,10
watch,6000,15
laptop,35000,5
Explanation: The discount on the mobile is 2000, the discount on the shoe is
500, the discount on the watch is 900 and the discount on the laptop is 1750.
So the discount on the shoe is the minimum.

4. 
You are required to implement the following function.
Int OperationChoices(int c, int a , int b )
The function accepts 3 positive integers ‘a’ , ‘b’ and ‘c ‘ as its arguments. Implement the 
function to return.
( a+ b ) , if c=1
( a – b ) , if c=2
( a * b ) , if c=3
(a / b) , if c =4
Assumption : All operations will result in integer output.
Example:
Input
c :1
a:12
b:16
Output:
Since ‘c’=1 , (12+16) is performed which is equal to 28 , hence 28 is returned.
Sample Input
c : 2
a : 16
b : 20
Sample Output
-4

The numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, between 12 and 50 both inclusive are {15, 30, 45} and 
their sum is 90.
Sample Input
m : 100
n : 160
Sample Output

 Fanny's Occurences
Fanny is given a string along with the string which contains a single character x. She has to 
remove the character x from the given string. Help her write a function to remove all 
occurrences of the x character from the given string
.
Input Specification:
input1: input string s
input2: String containing any character x
Output Specification:
String without the occurrence of character x
Example 1:
input1: welcome to metti
input2: i
Output: wecome to mett
Explanation: As I is the character that is required to be removed, therefore all the occurrences 
of I are removed, keeping all other characters

 Palindrome
Problem description:
Write a function to find if a given string is a palindrome or not. Return 0 if the input string is 
not a palindrome and 1 if the input string is a palindrome.
Note: A string is said to be a palindrome if the reverse of the string is the same as the string. 
For example, “abba” is a palindrome, but “abbc” is not a palindrome.
Input Specification:
input1: A string of characters
Output Specification:
0 or 1 depending on whether the string is a palindrome or not.
Example 1:
input1: level
Output: 1
Explanation:
The reverse of string “level” is “level”. As they are the same hence the string is a palindrome.
